# Say Cheese

> WARNING!! This project is a work in progress

Say Cheese is a (hopeful) You Ship We Ship program
focused on creating games and programs that can fit inside a single QR code.

The QR code standard is a collection of many different versions,
with the largest being version 40, encoding a measly 3 kilobytes of data.
For reference, the 700x500 pixel icon at the top of this README is a whopping 74 kilobytes.
This means you have to fit a fully functioning program into a package over 20x smaller than a logo.

There are two main methods to creating programs this small: HMTL+JS or an assembly language.

## HTML+JS

## Assembly
